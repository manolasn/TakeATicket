    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how the app developed by Nikiforos Manolas handles the collection, use, and protection of user data. This app integrates data from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie Database (TMDb)</a>.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The app does not collect or store any personal data. Any data displayed (such as movie titles, descriptions, or images) is fetched in real-time from TMDb.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of TMDb Data</h2>
    <p>All data provided by TMDb is used solely for display purposes. We do not modify or manipulate the data in any way, nor do we collect any user-generated content.</p>

    <h2>3. External Links</h2>
    <p>This app may contain links to external websites, including TMDb. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. Please review their privacy policies separately.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We take security seriously and implement measures to protect the data fetched from TMDb. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security over the network.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to the Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of the app following any changes will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
